Description: This module determines and returns standardized names for
        platforms, where the "standard" is Trent Mick's reasoning :)
        from experience building ActivePython on a fairly large number of
        platforms.
        
        The driving goal is to provide platform names that are:
        - relatively short
        - readable (as much as possible making matching the given name to an
        actually machine self-explanatory)
        - be capable enough to produce all names needed to distinguish all
        platform-specific application builds
        - generally safe for usage in filenames
        - not ugly (e.g. "MSWin32" is ugly)
        
        A simple usage example:
        
        >>> from platinfo import PlatInfo
        >>> pi = PlatInfo()
        >>> pi.os
        'macosx'
        >>> pi.arch
        'x86'
        >>> pi.name()
        'macosx-x86'
        
        Currently this has fairly wide OS coverage (Windows, Linux, Mac, Solaris,
        HP-UX, AIX).
